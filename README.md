# Applied Database Technologies Application

This GitHub repository was established as part of the final project for my Indiana University course, "D532-Applied Database Technology." The project revolves around the development of an interactive "NYC Airbnb Listings Web App." My fellow colleagues and I collaborated on this endeavor, utilizing MySQL for the creation and management of the database. The core of our project was the utilization of Shiny for the development of the web app, resulting in a cohesive and user-friendly platform for exploring NYC Airbnb listings. No deployment.
